# Introduction

On this page, we will be walking through an example system of actors in order to demonstrate how an actor system may be constructed. We will first demonstrate how actors themselves should be written, followed by a demonstration of a config file and a script to run improv. 

For this, we will be using the actor system used in the [wiki page](https://github.com/project-improv/improv/wiki/Minimal-working-example) for the example demo. We recommend that you first visit that page, run the demo, and read the explanation before continuing. 

# Building an actor

An actor is composed of several essential components: a constructor, a setup function, a run function, and a run helper function. There are also a few optional components, like a string representation, and a stop function. 

## Constructor
